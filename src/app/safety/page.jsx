        <b>OUR COMMITMENTS</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        Promoting an injury-free environment and the safest workplace possible
        for our employees, trade partners, clients, and project consultants.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our workplace is “Our House.” In our house, we foster a caring
        environment, where every person has a sense of belonging and knows that
        they are contributing to something extraordinary. Respect for people has
        always been at the heart of CECS Engineers Pvt. Ltd&apos;s culture. CECS
        Engineers Pvt. Ltd understands the environmental, social, and economic
        impact of our activities and that it is our responsibility to conduct
        business in a transparent manner that supports established goals for
        client service, environmental performance, and employee health, safety,
        and wellbeing. Our core values of integrity, teamwork, and commitment
        guide our activities, and we expect the contractors with which we do
        business to share our commitments.
        <br />
        <br />
        Recognizing the best practices will continue to evolve, we lead by
        example and serve as ambassadors for environment, health, safety, and
        sustainability. We will advocate for the best sustainable practices on
        our projects and in our company operations and will educate our staff

        Health, and Safety program in the industry.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Empowering Workforce</b>
        Our program strives to have increased involvement from those closest to
        the risk and the work during operational safety planning. As involvement
        and active participation increase, so does individual ownership of daily
        safety activities.
        <br />
        <br />
        Ultimately, by working this model consistently, it fosters a more
        well-rounded workforce that makes safe decisions, even when no one is
        watching, not only for themselves but also for others around them. The
        practice of safety evolves from a mandate to a value.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Leadership</b>
        Our team of EH&S professionals works together to ensure everyone that
        steps onto a CECS Engineers Pvt. Ltd job site or in an office feels
        safe.
        <br />
        <br />
        Guided by our national directors, our network of safety professionals is
        focused on developing a culture where all people feel that they are part
        of something extraordinary by managing risk, creating a safe
        environment, and demonstrating the highest standard of care for each
        other.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Safety</b>
        We are creating and sustaining a culture that promotes an incident-free
        environment and provides the safest workplace possible to live
        injury-free every day.
        <br />
        <br />
        Our program strives to eliminate worksite incidents and mitigate hazards
        through: operational safety pre-planning; shared EH&S standards and
        policies; mandatory inspections, training programs, and most
        importantly, by empowering trade workers.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Our efforts are guided by these key safety principles:</b>
        - All injuries are preventable. - Coach and practice safe behaviour. -
        Engage with teams to properly plan work. - Perform a task only if it is
        safe. - Speak up and stop work if there is an unsafe condition or a
        safer way to perform a task.
        <br />
        <br />
